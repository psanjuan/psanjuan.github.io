Welcome to my website! I am Priscilla, a experienced researcher in data analytics with a strong foundation in the biological sciences. 
Many of the techniques I have learned during my PhD and my postdoc have many applications beyond ecology and evolution. 
I am eager to use my transferable skills for data-driven decision-making from insights in healthcare, human resources, 
environmental mission-based work, or the entertainment and creative industries. Here, I would like to showcase some of 
my work with data. My featured data stories are mainly in ecological and evolutionary biology research. I am currently a 
postdoctoral researcher at the <a href = "https://nhm.org">Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County</a> looking for employment opportunities.
