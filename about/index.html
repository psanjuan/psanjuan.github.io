<h4>I am a third year PhD student in Tadashi Fukami's lab at Stanford University. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Science and a minor in Global Sustainability at the University of California, Irvine. As an undergraduate, 
I explored a range of research endeavors that include: antibiotic resistance in environmental bacteria, perchlorate toxicology in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the digestive physiology of two invasive fish species in Mexico. Broadly, I am interested in understanding the processes that shape the gut microbiome, particularly human-mediated disturbances, within but not limited to, birds. I am currently examining the effects of land use change, captivity, migration, and disease on avian gut microbial communities. I am hoping to integrate field, molecular, and computational methods in my work. </h4>
