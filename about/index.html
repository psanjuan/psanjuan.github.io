I am a skilled researcher in data analytics with a strong foundation in the biological sciences. Many of the techniques I have learned during my PhD and my postdoc have many applications beyond the ecology and evolution. I am eager to use my transferable tools for data-driven decision-making from insights in healthcare, human resources, environmental mission-based work, or the entertainment and creative industries.
