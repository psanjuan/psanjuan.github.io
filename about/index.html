I am a fourth year PhD student in <a href = "https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/">Tadashi Fukami's lab</a> at Stanford University. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Science and aÂ minor in Global Sustainability at the University of California, Irvine. 
Broadly, I am interested in understanding the processes that shape the gut microbiome, particularly how human-mediated disturbances, impact these communities in wildlife hosts. I am currently examining the effects 
of land use change, captivity, migration, and disease on avian gut microbial communities. I am hoping to integrate field, molecular, and computational methods in my work.
