I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in Kayce Bell's lab. I completed my PhD in <a href = "https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/"><b>Tadashi Fukami's lab</b></a> at Stanford University. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Science and aÂ minor in Global Sustainability at the University of California, Irvine. 
Broadly, I am interested in understanding what shapes relationships between hosts and the communities they harbor, including their commensal microbes and their parasites.
