  I am postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://nhm.org">Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County</a> in <a href="http://www.kaycebell.com"><b>Kayce Bell's lab</b></a>. I completed my PhD in <a href = "https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/"><b>Tadashi Fukami's lab</b></a> at Stanford University. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Science and aÂ minor in Global Sustainability at the University of California, Irvine. 
Broadly, I am interested in understanding what shapes relationships between hosts and the communities they harbor, including their commensal microbes and their parasites.
  <br><br>
During my PhD, I was funded by the <a href = "https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171962"><b>Ford Foundation</b></a> as a predoctoral fellow, as well as, by Stanford VPGE as a <a href = "https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/dare/details"><b>DARE Fellow</b></a>. If these fellowships are of interest to you, I am always happy to chat/help. Just send me an email!
