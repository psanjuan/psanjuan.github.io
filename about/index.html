I am currently a PhD student in <a href = "https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/"><b>Tadashi Fukami's lab</b></a> at Stanford University. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Science and aÂ minor in Global Sustainability at the University of California, Irvine. 
Broadly, I am interested in understanding the processes that shape the gut microbiome, particularly how human-mediated disturbances, impact these communities in wildlife hosts. I am currently examining the effects 
of land use change, captivity, migration, and disease on avian gut microbial communities. I integrate field, molecular, and computational methods in my work.
  <br><br>
  I am fortunate to be funded by the <a href = "https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171962"><b>Ford Foundation</b></a> as a predoctoral fellow, as well as, by Stanford VPGE as a <a href = "https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/dare/details"><b>DARE Fellow</b></a>. If these fellowships are of interest to you, I am always happy to chat/help. 
  <br><br>
  Currently, browsing postdoc opportunities! :) I am interested in molecular ecology, community ecology, conservation, and microbiome research. I am always excited to learn something new and enthusiastic about working with researchers with diverse backgrounds in various fields.
